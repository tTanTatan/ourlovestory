      <h1>Hola!! My <span> Brave Lion</span></h1>
      <p>Our love story begins with a single "Hey" followed by "Have You Ever Tried", a lyrics from the song Maybe the Night.<br>
You responded and complied despite how corny and embarrassing it sounded. I actually never expected that you will <br>
reply since I'm just someone who secretly admires you from afar. After a long conversation, I feel something in my <br>
stomach. (tae ata, jk) Something unexplainable, it feels like some sort of butterfly, something I never thought I <br>
would experience again. My world suddenly turns upside down when I met you. Everything changed, my mindset, my hope, <br>
and my dreams. You lift me up and bring light in my dark and misserable life. You bring joy, excitement, and kilig <br>
everytime. Because of you, my optimism was revived, and I once again began to believe in love. You are the cause <br>
under my charming smiles. As soon as I met you, everything started to go well. This is where everything <br>
between us started, where our love story begins, a story that will never end.<br><br>
